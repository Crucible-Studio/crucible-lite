# Device Context — RAG Evidence Base

This file is the primary evidence document for all agents operating under the
Crucible Constitutional Governance system. It is read by attorneys before
constructing hearing arguments, by the hw-advisor before making suggestions,
and by the simulator-operator when validating simulation parameters against
known hardware behaviour.

**Agents: read this file before any hearing argument or advisory session.**  
**Humans: keep this file current. A stale BOM or outdated test result here is
a constitutional violation under Article I (Signal First).**

Maintained by: human engineer (primary) + `/toolchain` command (hardware/pin sections).  
Updated after: every field test session, every BOM revision, every schematic change.

## Device Purpose

> [One paragraph. State what the device measures or controls, who or what depends
> on its output, and the cost of the two failure modes (false positive and false negative).
> Every hw-advisor suggestion and every attorney argument must be grounded in this
> statement. Delete this placeholder and write the real purpose before Stage 0.]

**Domain primitives** (traces to Article I):
1. [Primitive 1] ([unit]) — [one-line physical description]
2. [Primitive 2] ([unit]) — [one-line physical description]
3. [Primitive 3] ([unit]) — [optional]

## Operating Envelope

> Fill in after /spec collect Q6–Q8.

- **Normal conditions:** [temperature, humidity, vibration, mounting position, use duration]
- **Worst-case conditions:** [extremes of intended use the device must still handle]
- **Out-of-scope conditions:** [conditions explicitly NOT designed for — what voids the warranty]

---

## System Constraints

> Error 8 — Written by /spec collect Q9–Q11. Read by hw-advisor before any BOM recommendation.

| Constraint | Value | Implication |
|------------|-------|-------------|
| Battery    | [mAh] | Max avg current: [mA] |
| Form factor | [dimensions / weight] | Rules out: [list hardware options] |
| Field interface | [BLE only / USB+BLE / ...] | Mandatory smoke tests: [list] |
| System dependencies | [host app / cloud / other device] | Integration scope |

## Bill of Materials (BOM)

> Component-level record. Every component that touches a domain primitive must be here.
> Include part number, value/spec, supplier, and any substitution notes.
> Delete this instruction block and replace with your actual BOM.

| Ref | Component | Part Number | Value / Spec | Supplier | Notes |
|-----|-----------|-------------|--------------|----------|-------|
| U1  | [MCU board] | — | — | — | [e.g., must be Sense variant] |
| U2  | [Sensor] | — | [I2C addr, ODR, range] | — | — |
| R1  | [Resistor] | — | [Ω, tolerance, power] | — | — |
| C1  | [Capacitor] | — | [μF, voltage] | — | — |
| J1  | [Connector] | — | — | — | — |

**BOM revision:** [vX.Y — YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Known substitution constraints:**  
- [e.g., "U2: LSM6DS3TR-C only — LSM6DSO has different WHO_AM_I and I2C timing"]

---

## Circuit Notes

> Key connections, power rail topology, and any physical issues found during bring-up.
> Include anything an attorney might need to argue a signal-path or power-budget hearing.

### Power topology
- [e.g., "3.3V from on-board LDO via P1.08 software-switched power pin"]
- [e.g., "Battery: 3.7V Li-Po → USB-C charging via onboard PMIC"]

### Key signal paths
- [e.g., "IMU: I2C on SDA=P0.07 / SCL=P0.27, address 0x6A, INT1=P0.11"]
- [e.g., "LED RGB: P0.26 (red), P0.30 (green), P0.06 (blue) — active LOW"]

### Known circuit issues
- [e.g., "P0.27 is also the NFC antenna pin — configure as GPIO before use"]
- [e.g., "IMU power pin must be asserted HIGH ≥ 5ms before first I2C transaction"]

**Schematic revision:** [vX.Y — YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Schematic file:** [path or URL, or "not yet committed"]

## Test Results

> Structured record of every validation run. Agents cite entries here by date and type
> when making empirical arguments. An argument citing a test result not in this record
> is inadmissible under the Benjamin Franklin Principle.

### Field / HIL test log

| Date | Stage | Test type | Profile / scenario | Key measurement | Pass/Fail | Notes |
|------|-------|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------|-------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | 0 | HIL smoke | USB serial | [e.g., counter=100 ✓] | PASS | — |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 0 | HIL smoke | IMU I2C | [e.g., WHO_AM_I=0x6A ✓] | PASS | — |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 1 | Simulation | [profile] | [e.g., steps=100, SI=2.1%] | PASS | — |
| YYYY-MM-DD | 2 | Firmware | [scenario] | [e.g., SESSION_END in 18s] | PASS | — |

### Signal measurements (evidence pool)

> Discrete measurements cited in case law or Bills. Each entry must name the file
> and the physical quantity it supports.

| Date | Signal | Value | File / log | Physical quantity |
|------|--------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [e.g., gyr_y peak] | [e.g., 38.4 dps] | [log path] | [e.g., push-off angular velocity] |
| YYYY-MM-DD | [e.g., SI_interval] | [e.g., 2.3%] | [log path] | [e.g., bilateral symmetry] |

### Open anomalies

> Issues observed but not yet explained or resolved. An attorney may cite an open
> anomaly as evidence that a position is unsafe — it has the same weight as a
> confirmed measurement.

| Date observed | Description | Stage | Status |
|---------------|-------------|-------|--------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [what was seen] | [N] | [open / investigating / resolved YYYY-MM-DD] |

---

## Hardware Bring-up History

> Chronological record of significant hardware events: new revisions, failures,
> component swaps, and the reason for each. Attorneys use this to establish whether
> a current anomaly has a hardware precedent.

| Date | Event | Impact | Action taken |
|------|-------|--------|--------------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | [e.g., Rev A board received] | — | [toolchain init run] |
| YYYY-MM-DD | [e.g., I2C pullup too weak — 10kΩ → 4.7kΩ] | [IMU lost comms at 400kHz] | [BOM updated] |
